&nbsp;Developed an algorithm to identify and segregate the primary planes from a dataset, 

followed by the extraction and categorization of each into separate files based on 

their dominance.Engineered the solution with a focus on function-based modular programming, without 

reliance on external specifications, utilizing an advanced sorting technique to 

evaluate and rank three-dimensional points by their spatial magnitude.Enabled sophisticated I/O operations, 

ensuring precise parsing and representation of 3D coordinates, maintaining the integrity of the data structure order (x, y, z).
